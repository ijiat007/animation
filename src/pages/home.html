    I was a ghost, I was alone, hah
    어두워진, hah, 앞길속에 (Ah)
    Given the throne, I didn't know how to believe
    I was the queen that I'm meant to be
    I lived two lives, tried to play both sides
    But I couldn't find my own place
    Called a problem child 'cause I got too wild
    But now that's how I'm getting paid, 끝없이 on stage
